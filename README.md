This is the official implementation of SimpleUNet, a novel eaily scalable yet high-performance semantic segmentation model for medical images(Only for 2D at this moment). Without fantastic novel components, SimpleUNet is implmented Simply based on traditional U-Net by integrating interpretation-friendly feature selection, model width contraining(i.e., fixed model width for simplcity) and adaptive feature fusion. By doing so, the overall parameters can be greatly slashed while only 0.67 MB variant can achieve comparable or even better performance against the SOTA models such as TransUNet, UNetv2, Tiny-UNet and ESKNet, especially for breast lesion segmentation in Ultrasound and endoscopic polyps.

While there are novel computing components coming up everyday, it might be impossible to exhuasitvely explore  Many thanks to the great work of ESKNet,  which can be found at https://github.com/CGPxy/ESKNet. However, the original codes of ESKNet were implemented via Tensorflow. We , therefore, replicated them via Pytorch instead, on which we futher extend our SimpleUNet as SimpleESKNet, which showed more competitive performance regarding breast lesion and colonic polyps segmentation.
