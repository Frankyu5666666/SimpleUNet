This the official implementation of SimpleUNet, a novel eaily scalable yet high-performance semantic segmentation model for medical images. SimpleUNet is purely based on traditional U-Net with selected shortcut and deep features while the model width was fixed throughout the model. By doing so, the overall parameters are greatly reduced. To enhance the feature fusion between the shortcut features and the deep features, we introduce a minimal cost operation that recalibrate the each channel weight of them via Hardmard product. Overall, the model is much more compact while showing comparable or even better performance regarding breast lesion segmentation task or other tasks.

We futher extend the SimpleUNet on basis of ESKNet, which can be found at https://github.com/CGPxy/ESKNet. 
However, the original codes of ESKNet was implemented via Tensorflow. We , therefore, replicated it via Pytorch instead.
